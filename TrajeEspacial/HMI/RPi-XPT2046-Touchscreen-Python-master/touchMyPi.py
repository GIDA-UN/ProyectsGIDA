# Python proof of concept for interfacing an XPT2046 Touch Screen Controller
# to a Raspberry Pi using SPI (via bit-banged GPIO).

# This sample uses the SPI pins on the Raspberry Pi Expansion header.
# (With the intention that no wiring changes should be required to use SPI
# drivers, rather than bit-banged GPIO).

# More information on Raspberry Pi GPIO can be found here:
# http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals

# This sample code is dependent on the RPi.GPIO library available here:
# http://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO/
